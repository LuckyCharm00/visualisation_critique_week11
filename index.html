        <p id="text-n2">
        CS:GO has been very well-kwown for its aiming difficulty and the small hitboxes, making the game very difficult for beginners to play.

        <h2 id="title-n3">The Most Favourite Maps In CS:GO</h2>
        <p id="text-n3">
        There are many controversies revolving around CS:GO maps, many non-professional players exploit the fact that some of the maps are imbalanced, favouring either terrorists or counter-terrorists during matches.
        <br><br>
        In professional scenes, the most favourite map to play is Mirage, Inferno, and Train being played at 3188, 2951, and 2630 matches consecutively.
        <br><br>
        These maps are favoured because, they are relatively larger than other maps and provide the players more possible of strategies to execute. 
        <br><br>
        Therefore, providing a more balanced gameplay between either side of the oppositions.

        <h2 id="title-n4">The Most Hated Maps In CS:GO</h2>
        <p id="text-n4">
        In CS:GO professional scenes, before any matches, both sides of the oppositions are given a choice of 7 maps to play and each will be given 3 chances to remove a map alternately. Leaving 1 remaining map to play.
        <br><br> 
        As we can see, the most removed map is Nuke, being removed at first choice at a total of 6416 times. Followed by Overpass at 4939 times.
        <br><br> 
        The chart shows that Vertigo and Cobblestone as the least hated map of the game. But it is not true, these 2 maps are just so imbalanced that most professional CS:GO matches do not include them as a part of the choice.

        <h2 id="title-n5">Who Are The Most Dominant Teams In CS:GO ?</h2>
        <p id="text-n5">
        During the early rise of CS:GO popularity, the most dominant team is Cloud9 winning a total of 166 professional games in 2016 alone.
        <br><br> 
        In 2017, some other major CS:GO teams such as Tricked, Liquid, and Faze entered the top 4 leaderboard competing with Cloud9 as the number 1 spot with a slight 8 win difference. With Cloud9 still leading the pack with 152 total wins.
        <br><br>
        In 2018 onwards, Cloud9 popularity dramatically declines, this is caused by bad management and player performance. In 2018, Astralis took the number 1 spot from Cloud9 with a tremendous 207 total wins.
        <br><br> 
        Tricked became the number one team in 2019 with 205 total wins followed by liquid at 171 total wins. 
        <br><br> 
        In 2020, the total wins of all the teams dropped because there are no major professional events being held after the decline of CS:GO popularity, competition, and a hit from global pandemic.
        <br><br>
        Overall, the teams with the least performance fluctuation overtime are Liquid, fnatic, and mousesports.

# FIT3179 DATA VISUALISATION ASSIGNMENT 2 VEGA-LITE

The last facted multiplie line charts are suitable to be viewed from a 27-inch monitor down to 16-inch monitor. 
A smaller monitor can lead to the layout convering to the narrative.

This is caused by Vega-Lite not supporting Faceted Charts to be reactive (adjust to container size).

Currently the width of that specific chart is set to 300px.
